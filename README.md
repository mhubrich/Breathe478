## Usage

The 4-7-8 breathing technique is based on pranayama breathing exercises, an ancient yogic practice of controlling your breath. These types of mindful breathing exercises have been shown to have many benefits for stress reduction and relaxation.

It's done in three simple steps:
1. Inhale through your nose for **4** counts.
2. Hold your breath for **7** counts.
3. Exhale through your mouth for **8** counts.
